Peptide buCaTHL4B (AIPWIWIWRLLRKG) and Im-4 (FIGMIPGLIGGLISAIK-NH2) were synthesized by Sangon Biotech (Shanghai, China) using solid-phase 9-fluorenyl methoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) and purified to 98% using reversephase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Here is the origin data of Liquid Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer (LCMS) and High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) for buCaTHL4B and Im-4.
